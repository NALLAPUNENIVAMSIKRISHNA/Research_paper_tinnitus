# Research_paper_tinnitus
Tinnitus is a frequent sensory disorder that puts 
a lot of strain on the patient. Usually, tinnitus results from 
disturbances occurring to the sensory systems, such as the 
peripheral seldom central, the somatosensory system, the head 
and neck, or a mix of the two. This can be found in people with 
high stress, anxiety, depression, and hearing disorders. 
Although there is progress in the medical domain using artificial 
intelligence (AI), research related to tinnitus using AI is limited. 
This work aims to bridge the gap using deep-learning techniques 
for evaluating the patient record by examining various 
parameters. The proposed research also aims to target the same 
to understand the severity and possible recommendations for 
tinnitus disease. Our findings forecast how patients will react to 
tinnitus treatments. From the patients' electroencephalography 
(EEG) data, predictive EEG variables are extracted, and later 
feature selection approaches are used to determine the 
prominent features. The patient's EEG features are 
supplemented by AI algorithms for training and forecasting 
treatment outcomes. Higher accuracy levels of the proposed 
model using AI help the practitioners suggest the proper 
diagnosis for the patients and also check the patient's recovery 
over a period of time.
